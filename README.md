# MIT_tictactoe

For this assignment, I decided to try rewriting the program instead of using the startercode provided by the MIT module. I felt there might be a more simple way to get the program working, and I thought it would be a decent learning experience. I found it was certainly a good learning experience, and I personally think my version is a bit more simple, but that's a bit subjective.

## Future imporvements
In the future, I would like to add simple tweaks to make the app more appealing. The display is very basic right now as I was focusing on function over form. The other thing I would like to add is a game reset button that will reset the state of the game, either when a player clicks it, or after a winner or draw condition has been found.
